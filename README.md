ChronoLift - Your Personal Workout Tracker App.  
Track your lifts, measure your progress, crush your goals.

ChronoLift is a **local-first workout tracker** built with Flutter, Drift, and Supabase. It’s designed to give you full control of your training data while still allowing seamless syncing across devices when you sign in. 

**This project is currently in development!** 


## Features  
- **Track workouts** – Create workouts, add exercises, log sets, and monitor progress.  
- **Local-first** – All data is stored locally on your device first (using Drift/SQLite).  
- **Cloud sync** – Sign in with Supabase to sync your workouts across devices (In progress).    
- **Workout insights** – View advanced stats such as total sets completed this week, top 3 most performed exercises this month, bench press volume per workout over time, and more (In progress).  
- **Custom routines** – Add your own exercises and design training plans (In progress).  


## Tech Stack  
- **Flutter** – Cross-platform app framework for both iOS and Android
